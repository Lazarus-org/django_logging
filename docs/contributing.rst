Setting Up Your Environment
---------------------------

1. **Fork the Repository:**

   Begin by forking the `django_logging` repository on GitHub. This creates your own copy where you can make changes.

2. **Clone Your Fork:**

   Use the following command to clone your fork locally:

   .. code-block:: bash

       git clone https://github.com/your-username/django_logging.git
       cd django_logging

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the necessary dependencies using `Poetry`. If Poetry isn't installed on your machine, you can find installation instructions on the `Poetry website <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>`_.

   .. code-block:: bash

       poetry install

4. **Create a Feature Branch:**

   It’s a good practice to create a new branch for your work:

   .. code-block:: bash

       git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

Testing Your Changes
--------------------

We use `pytest` for running tests. Before submitting your changes, ensure that all tests pass:

.. code-block:: bash

    poetry run pytest

If you’re adding a new feature or fixing a bug, don’t forget to write tests to cover your changes.

Code Style Guidelines
----------------------

Maintaining a consistent code style is crucial. We use `black` for code formatting and `isort` for import sorting. Make sure your code adheres to these styles:

.. code-block:: bash

    poetry run black .
    poetry run isort .

For linting, `pylint` is used to enforce style and catch potential errors:

.. code-block:: bash

    poetry run pylint django_logging

Utilizing Pre-commit Hooks
--------------------------

Pre-commit hooks are used to automatically check and format code before you make a commit. This ensures consistency and quality in the codebase.

1. **Install Pre-commit:**

   .. code-block:: bash

       poetry add --dev pre-commit

2. **Set Up the Hooks:**

   Install the pre-commit hooks by running:

   .. code-block:: bash

       poetry run pre-commit install

3. **Manual Hook Execution (Optional):**

   To run all hooks manually on your codebase:

   .. code-block:: bash

       poetry run pre-commit run --all-files

Creating a Pull Request
-----------------------

Once your changes are ready, follow these steps to submit them:

1. **Commit Your Changes:**

   Write clear and concise commit messages. Following the `Conventional Commits <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>`_ format is recommended:

   .. code-block:: bash

       git commit -am 'feat: add custom logging formatter'

2. **Push Your Branch:**

   Push your branch to your fork on GitHub:

   .. code-block:: bash

       git push origin feature/your-feature-name

3. **Open a Pull Request:**

   Go to the original `django_logging` repository and open a pull request. Include a detailed description of your changes and link any related issues.

4. **Respond to Feedback:**

   After submitting, a maintainer will review your pull request. Be prepared to make revisions based on their feedback.

Reporting Issues
----------------

Found a bug or have a feature request? We’d love to hear from you!

1. **Open an Issue:**

   Head over to the `Issues` section of the `django_logging` repository and click "New Issue".

2. **Describe the Problem:**

   Fill out the issue template with as much detail as possible. This helps us understand and address the issue more effectively.
